# Timeseries Analysis

This project was submitted to the Network Analytics course at KTH. 

Forecasting can be defined as the process of making predictions based on past and present data. In this
project, we are presented with two datasets, mainly the Key-Value (KV) store based on traces collected from
the KTH testbed and the FedCSIS 2020 challenge dataset. We are asked to perform forecasting on the target
variables and to explore and compare various forecasting techniques. The rest of the report is structured in
four main tasks: Task I and II perform the forecasting using machine learning techniques (Linear Regression
and LSTM) while Tasks III and IV perform the forecasting using time series analysis.
